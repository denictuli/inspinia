# How to Download Fluid Mechanics by RK Rajput PDF for Free
 
Fluid mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of fluids (liquids and gases) at rest and in motion. Fluid mechanics has many applications in engineering, such as designing pumps, turbines, pipes, valves, and hydraulic systems.
 
One of the most popular textbooks on fluid mechanics is *A Textbook of Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulic Machines* by RK Rajput. This book covers both theoretical and practical aspects of fluid mechanics and hydraulic machines, with numerous examples, problems, and solutions. The book is divided into two parts: Part I deals with fluid mechanics and Part II deals with hydraulic machines.
