Digital image processing is the process of manipulating and analyzing digital images using computer algorithms. Digital images are composed of pixels, which are the smallest units of information that can be displayed on a screen. Each pixel has a numerical value that represents its color and intensity. By applying different operations to the pixels, such as arithmetic, logical, geometric, or filtering, we can modify the appearance and content of the images.
 
Some of the applications of digital image processing are:

One of the topics that Pengolahan Citra Digital by Darma Putra covers is image enhancement. Image enhancement is the process of improving the quality and visibility of an image by adjusting its contrast, brightness, sharpness, noise, etc. Image enhancement can be done in two domains: spatial domain and frequency domain. Spatial domain techniques operate directly on the pixels of the image, while frequency domain techniques transform the image into a different representation, such as Fourier transform, and then modify its components.
 
Some of the spatial domain techniques that Pengolahan Citra Digital by Darma Putra explains are:

- Point processing: This technique modifies each pixel based on its value and a predefined function. For example, negative transformation, logarithmic transformation, power-law transformation, etc.
- Neighborhood processing: This technique modifies each pixel based on its value and the values of its neighboring pixels. For example, linear filtering, median filtering, edge detection, etc.
- Global processing: This technique modifies the whole image based on a global property or criterion. For example, histogram equalization, histogram specification, etc.

Some of the frequency domain techniques that Pengolahan Citra Digital by Darma Putra explains are:

- Fourier transform: This technique transforms an image from spatial domain to frequency domain and vice versa. It decomposes an image into a sum of sinusoidal functions with different frequencies and amplitudes.
- Filtering: This technique modifies the frequency components of an image to enhance or suppress certain features. For example, low-pass filtering, high-pass filtering, band-pass filtering, etc.
- Restoration: This technique restores an image that has been degraded by noise or blur. For example, inverse filtering, Wiener filtering, etc.

Pengolahan Citra Digital by Darma Putra provides detailed explanations and examples of these techniques using MATLAB and OpenCV. You can download the PDF version of the book for free from Google Books and learn more about image enhancement and other topics in digital image processing.
