## What is FORM 1.1?
 
FORM 1.1 is a synthesizer that uses a sample as the primary oscillator for the synth engine. This means that you can load any sample from your own collection or from the included library, and use it as the starting point for your sound design. You can then manipulate the sample in various ways, such as changing its playback speed, direction, and behavior, modifying its amplitude curve, applying effects, and more.
 
FORM 1.1 also has a powerful modulation framework that allows you to modulate almost any parameter with ease. You can use envelopes, LFOs, macros, or even sidechain modulation sources to create complex movement and variation in your sound. You can also save multiple snapshots of sound parameters in performance slots, which you can apply to any sample and switch between them on the fly.
 
FORM 1.1 is a part of Native Instruments KOMPLETE bundle, which means that you can use it with other NI products such as REAKTOR 6, MASCHINE, KONTAKT, and more. You can also use it as a standalone instrument or as a plug-in in your DAW of choice.
