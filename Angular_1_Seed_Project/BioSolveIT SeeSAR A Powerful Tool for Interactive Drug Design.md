SeeSAR is an intuitive, visual drug design platform that covers every step of the drug discovery process â from virtual screening to fragment-based design. SeeSAR fosters ideation in the most fun and comprehensive way by providing a stimulating interface that creates a dialog between users and their compounds[^2^].
 
SeeSAR supports users in finding solutions in the most inspiring way by thinking outside the box. Users can feel their ideas progressing with swift calculations and informative feedback. SeeSAR provides users with a variety of tools and features to handle their compounds and target structures, such as:
 
- Protein Mode: Drag and drop your protein, or search comfortably in an online database. Within seconds, your target is prepared and you can get started.
- Protein Editor Mode: Modify your protein according to your needs. Explore rotamers, introduce mutations, and customize side chains.
- Binding Site Mode: SeeSAR automatically detects the binding site of a ligand for you. In addition, you can precisely expand it by adding individual residues â or with a single click to find empty pockets in your protein.
- Molecule Editor Mode: Modify molecules to your taste in 2D or 3D on-the-fly. Once you are done, the molecules are directly prepared for your tasks.
- Analyzer Mode: Estimate affinities and interpret the results using the visualized HYDE score. Filter your compounds for relevant parameters, calculate ADME properties, and gain full control over ligand-target interactions.
- Inspirator Mode: Ideate without limits! Discover new scaffolds, explore, and grow into free cavities, or link molecules using fragment libraries for elegant solutions.
- Docking Mode: Dock your compounds with one single click! Screen libraries for actives, and instinctively evaluate your results.
- Similarity Scanner Mode: Align your compounds without the need of a target structure based on their molecular similarity.

All these tools are based on solid and transparent science cited in over a thousand publications. SeeSAR also provides users with helpful features such as ADME properties assessment, comprehensive color coding, unoccupied binding pocket visualization, and many others[^1^].
 
If you want to experience the liberating drug design experience with SeeSAR, you can download it for free from various websites[^3^] [^4^] [^5^]. You can also request a trial license from BioSolveIT's website[^2^]. SeeSAR is compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems.
 
SeeSAR is your modern everyday drug design dashboard that will help you discover active molecules with confidence and ease. Try it today and see for yourself!
