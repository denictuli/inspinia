In this section, we will show you some examples of how AudioProc 1.83 Plugin for Winamp can improve your audio playback. We will use some screenshots and audio samples to illustrate the effects of the plugin on different types of audio sources. You can also download the audio samples and try them yourself with the plugin.
 
## Example 1: Music Playback
 
For this example, we will use a song from the genre of rock. The original song sounds good, but it lacks some punch and clarity. We will use AudioProc 1.83 Plugin for Winamp to enhance the song and make it sound more dynamic and crisp.
 
Here is a screenshot of the plugin settings we used for this example:
 ![Example 1 settings](example1.png) 
As you can see, we enabled the 10-band equalizer, the compressor, the limiter, and the stereo enhancer. We also adjusted the input and output levels to avoid clipping. We used a preset called "Rock" as a starting point and tweaked it slightly to suit our taste.
 
Here is a comparison of the original song and the processed song with AudioProc 1.83 Plugin for Winamp:

</audio> 
Original song
 <audio controls="">
<source src="processed1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 
Processed song
 
As you can hear, the processed song sounds louder, brighter, and more balanced than the original song. The equalizer boosted the low and high frequencies to add more bass and treble. The compressor reduced the dynamic range and made the song more consistent in volume. The limiter prevented any distortion or clipping from occurring. The stereo enhancer widened the stereo image and added some depth and space to the sound.
 
## Example 2: Podcast Playback
 
For this example, we will use a podcast from the genre of comedy. The original podcast sounds decent, but it has some background noise and some variations in volume. We will use AudioProc 1.83 Plugin for Winamp to clean up the podcast and make it sound more clear and smooth.
 
Here is a screenshot of the plugin settings we used for this example:
 ![Example 2 settings](example2.png) 
As you can see, we enabled the expander, the gate, the compressor, and the limiter. We also adjusted the input and output levels to avoid clipping. We used a preset called "Podcast" as a starting point and tweaked it slightly to suit our taste.
 
Here is a comparison of the original podcast and the processed podcast with AudioProc 1.83 Plugin for Winamp:
 <audio controls="">
<source src="original2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

</audio> 
Original podcast
 <audio controls="">
<source src="processed2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 
Processed podcast
 
As you can hear, the processed podcast sounds quieter, cleaner, and more even than the original podcast. The expander and the gate reduced the background noise and silenced any gaps between speech segments. The compressor reduced the dynamic range and made the podcast more consistent in volume. The limiter prevented any distortion or clipping from occurring.
